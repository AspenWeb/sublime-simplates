# Sublime Text Simplate Package

Package for Sublime Text 3 which provides syntax highlighting for [Simplates](http://simplates.org/).

TODO: Add screenshot

## Installation

- Make sure you've installed [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) if you haven't already.

- Search for 'Simplates' and install. For instructions on installing packages, view [Package Control - Usage](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/usage).

## Usage

- By default, the 'Simplates - Python' syntax will be applied to all `.spt` files.

## TODO

- Syntax highlighting only works with a simplate that has 3+ sections (initialization logic + request logic + content(s)). Add support for simplates with < 3 sections.
- Jinja2 syntax files have been copied into this repo. Find a way to embed/reference directly.
- Add more renderers, only `text/html`|`jinja2` is supported as of now.
